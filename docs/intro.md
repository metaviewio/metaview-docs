# Introduction

Metaview is a token **review**, **analytics** and **audit** platform. These three components will make up a comprehensive token overview 
which will be useful when researching coins to ensure that you don't invest in money grabs or scam tokens. This lines up 
with the fundamental Metaview goal to increase token quality in the crypto space by providing free, transparent and easily 
accessible data on tokens.

## Review Platform

The **review** platform allows anyone to submit a review for a coin or token **[here](https://metaview.io/review)**.
Reviews are publically visible and will provide a key component to the token reputation.

## Analytics

Token **analytics** will aim to give an overview of how much real use the token is getting. This will consist of on chain statistics such as tranactions per second, 
number of active wallets, spread of funds between wallets etc.

The analytics platform has not been built yet and is a roadmap item.


## Audits

Smart contract **audits** will be done on specific tokens. These will be done to ensure the quality of the smart contract to ensure the smart contract
 is secure and not vulnerable to hacking and also to review the smart contract functionality in terms of the functions it provides.

Smart contract auditing has not started yet and is a roadmap item.
