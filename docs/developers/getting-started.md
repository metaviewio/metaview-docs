# Getting Started

The Metaview API allows token ratings to be stored on the blockchain and accessed by anyone.

Developers can integrate with Metaview using a javascript library such as [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) or directly from within a smart contract using [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).

The following documentation will help you get started by providing examples and an API reference.
